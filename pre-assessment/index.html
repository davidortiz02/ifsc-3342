    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!-->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p><img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" title="meme"/>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>

    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>Both of these attributes give a bit more information about whatever they're attributed to, with a few differences between them. 
    The alt attribute is an accessibility attribute, making it so information relating to the object, like an image, can be read by screenreaders, or if the object is unavailable.
    The title attribute is related to the object in that it generally serves as a hover tooltip.
    Both of these attributes can work along each other and don't exclude one another, it's up to the developer to decide which and when to use the attributes.</p>

    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <dl>
     <dt>developer</dt>
      <dd>one that develops: such as</dd>
      <dd>a chemical used to develop exposed photographic materials</dd>
      <dd>a person who develops real estate</dd>
      <dd>a person or company that develops computer software</dd>
    </dl>
